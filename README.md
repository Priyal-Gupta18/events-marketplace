# events-marketplace

Overview of the Project:
The event marketplace project is a comprehensive platform that allows sellers to list their services, and users to book these services, all while providing a user-friendly interface. It incorporates several advanced features, including real-time booking notifications, a sophisticated user role management system, and a responsive design.

Key Functionalities:
Service Listing and Booking:

Sellers can create, edit, and delete services.
Users can browse, filter, and book services based on categories and preferences.
Automatic fetching of seller categories ensures that only relevant services are listed.
Real-Time Notifications:

Sellers receive real-time notifications when a booking is made, improving responsiveness and user engagement.
Implemented using API polling, ensuring that sellers are instantly aware of new bookings.
Image Upload and Management:

Sellers can upload images for their services, stored securely in an "uploads" directory.
Images are resized and displayed consistently across the platform, ensuring a uniform user experience.
Security Measures:

Implemented robust user authentication and role-based access control to ensure that only authorized users can access specific functionalities.
Image uploads are restricted to certain file types to prevent malicious uploads.
Responsive Design:

The platform is fully responsive, providing a seamless experience across devices, from desktops to mobile phones.
Advanced Technologies:
Backend:

PHP: Used for server-side scripting and handling form submissions, database interactions, and session management.
MySQL: Manages the database, storing user information, service details, and booking records.
Frontend:

HTML/CSS: Provides the structure and styling for the user interface.
JavaScript: Enhances user experience with dynamic content loading, form validation, and real-time updates.
Deployment:

AWS: The platform is deployed on AWS using EC2 for hosting the website and RDS for managing the MySQL database.
Domain Hosting: A domain is linked to the AWS-hosted application, providing users with a public URL.
Working:
Seller Workflow:

Sellers log in, create services, and manage their listings.
They receive notifications whenever a booking is made, allowing them to respond quickly.
User Workflow:

Users can browse services, filter by category, and book services directly from the platform.
They receive booking confirmations via email.
Advantages:
Scalability: The platform can handle multiple users and services without significant performance degradation, thanks to its robust backend and efficient database queries.
User Engagement: Real-time notifications and a user-friendly interface keep both sellers and users engaged.
Security: Proper session management and role-based access ensure that only authorized actions are performed.
Disadvantages:
Complexity: The platform's complexity can make it challenging to maintain, particularly as more features are added.
Resource-Intensive: Running the platform on AWS, while powerful, may incur costs if usage exceeds the free tier.
Future Scope:
Enhanced Real-Time Features:

Integrating WebSockets for even more immediate notifications and interactions.
Adding a chat feature for direct communication between users and sellers.
Mobile App Integration:

Developing a mobile app version of the platform to reach a broader audience and provide a more native experience.
Advanced Analytics:

Implementing analytics tools to provide sellers with insights into user behavior, helping them optimize their service offerings.
Global Expansion:

Adding support for multiple languages and currencies to cater to a global audience.
